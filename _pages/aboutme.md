As an engineering student, I've had the opportunity to work on many interesting & challenging projects. 

I started coding in 2019 when I was in high school, and immediately fell in love w/ it. When the pandemic hit, I took this opportunity to work on my first game: Space Invaders. That's also when I first started coding in HTML & CSS and found out graphic design was NOT my passion. Meanwhile, I was studying mathematics and physics. 

In 2020, I entered Lycée Saint-Louis in Paris, a top 3 school preparing nationwide competitive exams for French Grandes Écoles (also known as CPGE). These two years were intense and very demanding, but it made me an even better STEM student. It allowed me to sharply hone my technical skills and develop my scientific curiosity. I mostly coded in C and OCaml (a relatively unknown language useful for functional programming). Moreover, I learned in-depth theoretical knowledge about computer science, like formal languages, or automata theory. During these years, I coded an OCaml version of the game 2048, as well as an evacuation simulation of a building. 

<!-- In 2023, I was accepted to Enseirb-Matmeca.  -->

Furthermore, I'm also fond of humanities as well. When I'm not working, I try to read as much as I can. Here are my favorite ones :

    <h3>White Nights by Dostoevsky</h3>
    <p>
      "Set in St. Petersburg, it is the story of a young man fighting his inner restlessness. A light and tender narrative, it delves into the torment and guilt of unrequited love."

    <h3>The Picture of Dorian Gray by Wilde</h3>
    <p>
      "Enthralled by his own exquisite portrait, Dorian Gray exchanges his soul for eternal youth and beauty. Influenced by his friend Lord Henry Wotton, he is drawn into a corrupt double life, indulging his desires in secret while remaining a gentleman in the eyes of polite society. Only his portrait bears the traces of his decadence."
