As an engineering student, I've had the opportunity to work on many interesting & challenging projects. 

I started coding in 2019 when I was in high school, and immediately fell in love w/ it. When the pandemic hit, I took this opportunity to work on my first game: Space Invaders. That's also when I first started coding in HTML & CSS and found out graphic design was NOT my passion. Meanwhile, I was also studying mathematics and physics. 

In 2020, I entered Lycée Saint-Louis in Paris, a top 3 school preparing nationwide competitive exams for French Grandes Écoles (also known as CPGE). Those two years were intense and very demanding. Nevertheless, it allowed me to hone my technical skills. I mostly coded in C and OCaml (a relatively unknown language useful for functional programming). Moreover, I also learned in-depth theoretical knowledge about computer science, like formal languages, or automata theory. 

<!-- In 2023, I was accepted to Enseirb-Matmeca.  -->
