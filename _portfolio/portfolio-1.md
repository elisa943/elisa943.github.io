During my two years in Lycée Saint-Louis, I had to work on a project called TIPE (Travail d'Initiative Personnelle Encadré). It's a year-long project where students have to work on a scientific topic of their choice, related to a certain topic. That year, the topic was "La Ville" (The City). I chose to work on an evacuation simulation of a building.
